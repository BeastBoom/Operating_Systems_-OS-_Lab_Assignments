# 📘 Assignment 1: CPU Scheduling  
  
## 🔹 Algorithms Implemented  
- First Come First Serve (FCFS)  
- Shortest Job First (SJF - Non Preemptive)  
  
## ⚙️ Functionality  
- Process creation with PID, Arrival Time, Burst Time  
- Calculation of:  
  - Completion Time (CT)  
  - Turnaround Time (TAT)  
  - Waiting Time (WT)  
- Gantt Chart visualization  
- Average WT & TAT calculation  
- Comparison between FCFS and SJF  
  
## 📊 Key Insight  
SJF performs better than FCFS in minimizing waiting time by prioritizing shorter processes.

# 📘 Assignment 2: Banker’s Algorithm  
  
## 🔹 Concept  
Banker’s Algorithm is used to avoid deadlock by ensuring the system remains in a **safe state**.  
  
## ⚙️ Functionality  
- Input:  
  - Allocation Matrix  
  - Maximum Matrix  
  - Available Resources  
- Calculation:  
  - Need Matrix = Maximum - Allocation  
- Safety Algorithm:  
  - Checks if system is SAFE or UNSAFE  
  - Generates Safe Sequence  
- Step-by-step execution tracing  
  
## 🔐 Key Insight  
The system avoids deadlock by only allowing execution when resources satisfy:
